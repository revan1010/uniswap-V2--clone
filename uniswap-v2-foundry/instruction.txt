Homework 5: Rewrite Uniswap v2

UniswapV2 was written three years ago and uses outdated versions of Solidity tools
Project goals:
Learn the UniswapV2 implementation
Learn Foundry, the next generation ethereum development environment
You may use any online resources for the project.
Read through the UniswapV2 code:
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core
https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery
Class Notes 
Copy the UniswapV2 code into a new Foundry project
The original code had the core and periphery contracts in different repos. 
Combine them into a single repo to simplify development.
Make copies of the libraries rather than using package management.
Do not include UniswapV2Router01.
Upgrade the UniswapV2 code to the latest Solidity version that Foundry supports.
Write Solidity tests that achieve 100% line coverage for each of the following contracts:
UniswapV2Router02
UniswapV2Pair
UniswapV2Factory
Generate a line coverage report to assess the quality of your tests.
